## Development

The admin panel is built with a modular architecture:

- **AdminLayout**: Manages the overall layout and page switching
- **Sidebar**: Handles navigation between different admin sections
- **Individual Components**: Each major feature has its own component

This structure makes it easy to add new admin features in the future.
