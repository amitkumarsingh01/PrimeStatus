# Video Sharing Troubleshooting Guide

## Simple Solution Summary

1. **Get video URL from Firebase** ✅
2. **Add overlays to entire video** ✅  
3. **Share the processed video** ✅

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to process video for sharing"

**Possible Causes:**
1. FFmpeg not installed properly
2. Video URL is invalid
3. Insufficient storage space
4. Network issues

**Solutions:**

#### 1. Check FFmpeg Installation
```bash
# Run this in your terminal to check if FFmpeg is working
flutter pub get
```

#### 2. Check Video URL
Make sure your video URL is valid:
- Network URL: `https://example.com/video.mp4`
- Base64: `data:video/mp4;base64,ABC123...`

#### 3. Check Console Logs
Look for these debug messages in your console:
```
Starting video processing for: [URL]
Video downloaded to: [PATH]
Overlay created at: [PATH]
FFmpeg command: [COMMAND]
FFmpeg logs: [LOGS]
```

#### 4. Test with Simple Video
Try with a small, simple MP4 video first.

### Issue: Video Processing Takes Too Long

**Solution:** Use the "Thumbnail" option instead of "Full Video"

### Issue: App Crashes During Processing

**Solutions:**
1. Check available memory
2. Use smaller videos
3. Try thumbnail option first

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Dependencies
Make sure these are in your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  ffmpeg_kit_flutter: ^6.0.3
  video_thumbnail: ^0.5.3
  screenshot: ^3.0.0
  share_plus: ^7.2.1
```

### Step 2: Run Flutter Pub Get
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Check Permissions
Make sure you have storage permissions:
```dart
// Request storage permission
var status = await Permission.storage.request();
```

### Step 4: Test with Console Logs
The app now prints detailed logs. Check your console for:
- Video download status
- Overlay creation status  
- FFmpeg command and logs
- File paths

## Quick Test

1. Open a video post in fullscreen
2. Tap the share button
3. Choose "Thumbnail" option (faster)
4. Check console logs for errors

## Expected Flow

1. ✅ Video URL detected
2. ✅ Video downloaded to temp storage
3. ✅ Overlay image created
4. ✅ FFmpeg processes video with overlay
5. ✅ Processed video shared
6. ✅ Temp files cleaned up

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check FFmpeg logs** in console
2. **Try thumbnail option** first
3. **Use smaller video** for testing
4. **Check storage space** on device
5. **Restart app** and try again

## Alternative: Server-Side Processing

If client-side processing fails, consider:
1. Upload video to Firebase Storage
2. Process on server with FFmpeg
3. Download processed video
4. Share the result

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check console logs
2. Try with different video formats
3. Test on different devices
4. Consider server-side processing
